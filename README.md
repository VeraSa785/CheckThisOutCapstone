# Check This Out!

## About

This is my Capstone project in Ada Developers Academy. In this project, I learned iOS Development using Swift, SwiftUI, MVVM, Firebase, Git & GitHub, and Xcode.

## Idea

The “Check this out!” app is the perfect solution for people who often forget things when they're on the go. Whether you're packing for a camping trip or just trying to remember to grab your lunch on the way to work, “Check this out!” can help you keep track of everything you need.
It is easy to use. Simply create a specific list, choose a category (work, school, camping, etc.), and add a description. Inside each list, specify the things you need to grab. Open and check them before you go! This is more than just a to-do list, it is your personal helper for your memory. Free up your brain and just check things in the app.

What I learned:

- Builded an IOS app from scratch
- Learned SwiftUI by building basic to advanced UI layouts
- Implemented Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture
- Registered and authenticate users using Firebase
- Communicated with 'Firebase Firestore' Database (read/write)
- Used Git & GitHub for version control
- Created functions, enums, and extensions for clean and reusable code
- Created custom views and modifiers for best practices
- Used Scrum and Agile project methodologies
